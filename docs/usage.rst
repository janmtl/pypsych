At it's core, pypsych is a tool that performs one function: it takes in
physiological data from a psychology experiment and a human-readable description
of the experiment and then processes and collates all of the data for further
analysis. Possible output formats include pandas dataframes (when pypsych is
used inside a python script), csv/tsv files, and excel files.

To use PyPsych in a project::

    import pypsych
